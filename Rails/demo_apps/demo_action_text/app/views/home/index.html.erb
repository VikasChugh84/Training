It encourages and facilitates the use of web standards such as JSON or XML for data transfer, HTML, CSS and JavaScript for user interfacing.</p>

<h4 style="color: green;">Angular Js Development</h4>
<p>AngularJS is a JavaScript-based open-source front-end web framework mainly maintained by Google and by a community of individuals and corporations to address many of the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications. It aims to simplify both the development and the testing of such applications by providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller (MVC) and model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) architectures. The AngularJS framework works by first reading the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) page, which has additional custom HTML attributes embedded into it. Angular interprets those attributes as directives to bind input or output parts of the page to a model that is represented by standard JavaScript variables. The values of those JavaScript variables can be manually set within the code, or retrieved from static or dynamic JSON resources. AngularJS is currently in the top 100 of the most starred projects on GitHub.</p>
<p>By hiring AngularJS developers from Beryl Systems will give you the clean code and quality deliverables on AngularJS development services that meet your programming needs fom Angular 1.0 to Angular 6.0.</p>
