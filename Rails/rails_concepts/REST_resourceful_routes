REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer.

* It describes resources (in our case URLs) on which we can perform actions. CRUD , which stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete, are the actions that we perform.

* It uses HTTP requests to access and use data.

REST HTTP VERBS:

GET - Objective - Retrieve items from resource - links
 
POST - Objective - Create new item in resource - forms

PATCH - Objective - Update existing item in resource - forms

DELETE - Objective - Delete existing item in resource - links,forms


------------------------------------ RESOURCEFUL ROUTES ----------------------------------------

The combination of using CRUD with restful routes leads us to resourceful routes.

Instead of using simple routes we use resourceful routes in this way.

Taken our application example we use it like

* resources :subjects

* resources :pages

It is generally considered best practice to use resourceful routing when we are actually doing CRUD on a resource.

We can also skip one of or multiple actions from resources like

* resources :subjects, :except => [:show]

=> delete action is not defined by default in resourceful routes, we can specify it like

resources :subjects do
  member do
    get :delete
  end
end

resources :pages do
  member do
    get :delete
  end
end

=> To add other collections of action for particular controller, it would be like.

resources :books do
  member do
    get :delete
  end
    
  collection do
    get :all_books_count
    get :related_subject
    get :check_book
    get :check_subject
  end
end

---------------------------------- RESOURCEFUL URL HELPERS -------------------------------------

If we are using resourceful routes in our project then all the links and forms need to be use URL HELPERS to match those routes.
  
  Route               -    Action              -       Url Helper          -       Request

* subjects            -    index               -      subjects_path        -         GET

* subjects/:id        -    show                -      subject_path(:id)    -         GET

* subjects/new        -    new                 -      new_subject_path     -         GET

* subjects            -    create              -      subjects_path        -         POST

* subjects/:id/edit   -    edit                -      edit_subject_path(:id) -       GET

* subjects/:id        -    update              -      subject_path(:id)    -         PATCH

* subjects/:id/delete -    delete              -      delete_subject_path(:id) -     GET

* subjects/:id        -    destroy             -      subject_path(:id)    -         DELETE
