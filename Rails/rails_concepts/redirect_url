redirect_to is send the new request to browser.

Lets understand with example from books controller:

def check_book
  redirect_to :controller => 'demo', :action => 'show'
  # This can redirect request to show action of demo controller. 
end

def check_subject
  redirect_to controller: 'books', action: 'related_subject'
  # This can redirect to check action of books controller
  # Redirect could be written in above format as well.
end

Under check_book method point to be noted is server takes two requests 

* First request is of get 'books/check_book', when it goes into controller new request generate of url redirect.

-------------------------------- render vs redirect ----------------------------

There is an important difference between render and redirect_to: render will tell Rails what view it should use but redirect_to sends a new request to the browser.

To be notice : When we render top url remains same only view template is rendered on the other hand under  redirect url changes to specfied action and controller.
