render terms belongs to template i.e views.

Example:

class DemoController < ApplicationController
   
  def index
  end

  def show
  end

end

By default behaviour suggests current action pointed to its template as defined in its routes.

Lets try render:

Syntax: 
render(:template => 'demo/index') could be written as render('demo/index') or if its in same controller we
can use render('index')

Here under 'demo/index' considered demo as folder from views directory instead of demo as controller and index as html page defined under that folder.

How it works?

def index
  render ('demo/show')
  # This can render the show template of demo folder.
end

def show
  render ('demo/index')
  # This can render the index template of demo folder.
end
