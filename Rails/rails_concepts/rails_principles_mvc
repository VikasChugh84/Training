Rails is the web framework - set of code libraries and data structures provide generic functionality that can be further customize to create desired web app.

Principles:

* Follow DRY Code - Concise and consistent code that is easy to maintain.

* Convention over configuration - It means code is preconfigured to use default options that fits on most common usages.

---------------------- MVC Architecture -----------------------------

Model - View - Controller

* Model - Active Record - Data code goes into model - Handles data - Interacts with Database.

* View - Action View - Presentation code goes into view - Handles presentation.

* Controller - Action Controller - Decesion code goes into controller - Handles decesions.

Action Pack term is the combination of Action Controller and Action View.

Workflow:

Browser(request) -> Controller(request) -> Model(Processed the query) -> Controller(Decides the conclusion) -> View(uses html,css and further sends it back browser in user readable format)-> Browser


----------------------Creating new rails app -------------------------

* rails new 'app_name' -d 'database'
  # we can define our database the one we would like to work on like mysql, postgresql etc.In case we didn't mention it by default it takes 'sqlite3'.
