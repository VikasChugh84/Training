Routes - It's an resourceful route that provides a mapping between browser URL's to controller actions.When the request comes web server should know about where to redirect the specific request and that can be done with help of routes.

routes.rb file is located under config folder 

On web, usually we have get and post request.

a.) :get - It is used to retreieve information.

b.) :post - It is used to post or submit information.


(Most popular routes as of now are resourceful routes)

Types of Routes

---------------------------- Simple match route --------------------------------- 

These are generated when we generate our controller and its view.
    
=> get 'demo/index'

Expanded version - match "demo/index", :to => "demo/index", :via => :get
# Latest rails not supported, didn't take the controller

=> match '/demo/:index', :to => 'demo#index', :via => :get

This will work but issue here is it takes all the other actions request to this action itself.

=> Example: match '/demo/:show', :to => 'demo#show', :via => :get

This one also redirect to index action by default

Best suggested way is use of simple routes or resourceful routes comes later.

=> get 'demo/index'
=> get 'demo/show'

Sending request to index action of demo controller, matching means the string we are matching should have available controller and action.


----------------------------- Default route ------------------------------------

Basic Structure: 

=> :controller/:action/:id

Lets understand with example say we have students contoller and their is a method role under it.

Routes would be like:

=> get ':students(/:role)'

Expanded form - match ':students(/:role)', :via => :get

Consider we have role_id 4 to match, routes would be like

=> get ':students(/:role(:/4))'

Expanded form - match ':students(/:role(:/4))'. :via => :get


----------------------------- Root route ---------------------------------------

It's only purpose route a request to root of application say home page.It can be defined 
on top under routes .rb.

Basic Structure:

root "demo#index"

Expanded form match "/", :to => "demo#index", :via => :get

# Here "/" means match nothing


------------------------------ Resourceful route -------------------------------

Cover later.
