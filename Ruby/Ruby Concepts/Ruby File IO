Base class for ruby I/O methods is class IO.

* puts - It instructs the program to display the entire value stored in the variable. 
  x = "Best approach is never quit"

  puts x => "Best approach is never quit"

* putc - It instructs the program to display one character at a time.
  x = "Best approach is never quit"

  putc x => "B"

* print - Cursor under it points on same line instead of next line like puts.

* gets - It can be used to take any input from the user from standard screen called STDIN.
