-------------Understanding Constants--------------------

Sometimes we want certain variable whose value we never want to change. we can do this by creating what are called constants.Technically constants just need to begin with a capital letter but better practice is entire variable uppercase.

It is possible to reassign a new value to constants but Ruby will throw a warning.

=> Refer program class_variables_methods_constant.rb


------------------- Access Modifiers ---------------------

Method Access Control - It is generally implemented through the use of access modifiers. The purpose of access modifiers is to allow or restrict access to a particular thing.

Access Modifiers - Public / Private / Protected methods

a.) Public methods - Open for anyone and we can call these methods outside the class.

b.) Private methods - These can access from other methods only inside the class and then we can call that specific method from outside the class.

c.) Protected methods - It's in between approach between public and private.

    From Inside the class - protected methods are accessible just like public methods.

    From Outside the class - protected methods act just like private methods.
